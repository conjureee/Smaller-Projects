## üêç Python 

### ‚ùì What's here?
- My Python Mini-Projects, Checkpoints etc.
- Mostly made in free time

### ‚ú® What do I try to achieve in here
I try to get better at Python with each Mini-Project, 'cause in my opinion it's a very easy to understand, great and reliable Programming Language, which can provide much value in many projects, also having fun with coding in this Language.
